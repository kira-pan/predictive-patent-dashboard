This dashboard was built as part of a JCP research initiative studying how USPTO
Office Actions influence the likelihood that a patent application receives allowance.  
Our dataset contains thousands of applications across USPTO Technology Centers with detailed
information on rejection types, citation severity, prior-art characteristics, and outcomes.

The goal is to make these insights usable early in the drafting process by combining:

- Exploratory data analysis across USPTO Tech Centers  
- A trained XGBoost model predicting allowance probability  
- Scenario testing to evaluate how specific factors influence outcomes  

This tool **does not replace legal advice**. It provides a data-driven perspective on historical
examination patterns to support strategic decision-making.
